      "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is transforming how we interact with data, but it's not without its pitfalls. \n\n### The Problem with Chunks\n\nMost RAG pipelines fail because they naively chunk text. Fixed-size chunking often splits context in half, leading to retrieved context that misses the point.\n\n### The Solution: Semantic Splitting\n\nBy using embedding similarities to determine break points, we can keep semantically related text together. This drastically improves retrieval quality.\n\n### Hybrid Search\n\nDon't rely solely on vector search. Keyword search (BM25) is surprisingly effective for specific terms (like product SKUs or proper nouns). Combining both (Hybrid Search) is the gold standard.",

It connects Gmail, Slack, and our CRM via Webhooks.\n\n### The Workflow\n\n1. **Email Parsing**: Every inbound lead email is parsed by GPT-4 via an API call.\n2. **Qualification**: The AI scores the lead based on budget and timeline.\n3. **Action**: High-score leads get a drafted reply and a Slack notification. Low-score leads get tagged for later review.\n\nThis system alone saves me 15 hours a week.",

Form handling without API routes is a game changer for DX (Developer Experience).\n\n### Caching Gehenna\n\nThe caching strategy is still... aggressive. You need to really understand `revalidatePath` and `revalidateTag` or you'll serve stale data forever.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUpgrade for the stability, stay for the Server Components.",
